# MachineLearningGoogleDevCrashCourse
Today I started Machine Learning Crash Course from Google Developers. I will be sharing my learning journey here. 

Day #1 

I've learned about so many things from linear relationships to reducing loss. 

Also about generalization and overfitting. 
Lastly we looked up to train, test and validation sets.
After finishing the Validation part of the course, I've given a data set called California House Pricing. 
I used TensorFlow for the first time. My starter project is in the first day code.
